1. This is a sample application with basic functionality for the purposes of assessing technical candidates only.
2. Do not be overly concerned if there is code in this application which does not appear to do anything or is imperfect. Just focus on the converting python2 to python3.
3. Usually it takes about 2 hours in total on installation and these tasks. To respect your time, we don't ask that you spend more than this, and it is ok if you do not get to everything.
4. Write your code as if you were a team member working on a joint codebase with other developers and follow good team-based development practices.  Assume your fellow teammates have not seen the project requirements.  
5. Assume you are writing this code for a production environment where errors and edge-cases should be handled gracefully.  
6. This technical assessment is testing your *python developer* abilities, consider the setup of the environment as part of the assessment.
